    <h1 id='help'> How To Play Hits and Blows </h1>

    <p>In this game, the computer picks a sequence of four colors out of a list of six, with no repeats. For example, it might generate <span class='blue-text'>blue</span>, <span class='red-text'>red</span>, <span class='orange-text'>orange</span>, <span class='pink-text'>pink</span>, but never <span class='pink-text'>pink</span>, <span class='pink-text'>pink</span>, <span class='green-text'>green</span>, <span class='green-text'>green</span>. Your goal as the player is to guess this sequence in 8 attempts or less.</p>
    <p>Each turn, you make your guess by clicking a color on the right in order to select it. Then click on the white square you believe will be that color. Remember, there will be no duplicates.</p>
    <p>Once you've added a color to all four squares, click "Check" at the bottom of the column to see if you were right. The computer will tell you how close you were in the 2x2 grid above each column.</p>
    <p>A red square is a <b>hit</b>. This means that one of your squares has the correct color AND the correct position. A yellow square is a <b>blow</b>, which means one of the colors is correct but NOT in the right position. A blank square is a <b>miss</b>, meaning that neither the color or position was correct.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that the order of the hits and blows does NOT correspond to the sequence of your guesses. A hit means that ANY of the squares is a hit, etc.</p>
    <p>If you're still not sure how the game works (or just want a few laughs), <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBOyapv_7GA' target='_blank'>here is a link</a> to a video of two YouTubers playing another version of it that might help to visualize the way it works.</p>
